 *  Defines the active lifetime of an Observable. You can use 
 *  - globalScope: the observable will stay active forever, connected to its underlying data sources
 *  - autoScope: the observable will be active as long as it has observers (will throw if trying to re-activate)
 *  - custom scopes for, e.g. component lifetimes (between mount/unmount)
